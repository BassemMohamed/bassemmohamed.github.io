Hey! I am <b>Bassem Ibrahim</b>, I am a frontend developer with <b>5+</b> years
of experience, I am super passionate about building clean & simple UI. Mid-2020,
I managed to relocate to Germany during the panademic. You can read about the
whole story
[here](https://getbyrd.com/en/blog/relocating-to-germany-during-the-pandemic).
Couple of years ago, I was very much into writing. I wrote technical blog posts
on [dev-to](https://dev.to/bassemmohamed). I published <b>30+</b> articles that
haveÂ <b>33,000+</b> total post views. Currently, I am more interested in
mentoring. I do 1:1 mentoring session over at a platform called
[ADPlist](https://adplist.org/mentors/bassem). I try to do my part and give back
to the community by helping devs find their first jobs and prepare for
interviews.
