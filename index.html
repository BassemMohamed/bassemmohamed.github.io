          Hi, I am <b>Bassem</b>, a software engineer with <b>6+</b> years of
          experience. I am originally from the land of the pyramids but I moved
          to Berlin 3 years ago during the pandemic, You can read about that
          story
          <a
            href="https://getbyrd.com/en/blog/relocating-to-germany-during-the-pandemic"
            target="_blank"
            >here</a
          >
          or
          <a
            href="https://www.joinimagine.com/advice-for-juniors-how-bassem-made-it"
            target="_blank"
            >here</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          I spent the last 3 years working for a
          <a href="https://getbyrd.com" target="_blank"
            >3rd-party logistics company.</a
          >
          I jump started the design system, overhauled the UI components
          library, launched new dashboards, owned complex projects, talked to
          customers, showed off features, wrote documentation, hired developers
          & mentored others. But <b>the big lesson</b> I learned is that there
          often isn't a single flawless solution, and a skilled developer is
          someone who can capably choose the most suitable approach based on
          their present circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
          Couple of years ago, I was very much into writing. I wrote technical
          and personal posts over at
          <a href="https://dev.to/bassemmohamed" target="_blank">dev-to</a>. I
          published <b>30+</b> articles that have <b>33,000+</b> total views.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nowadays, I am more interested in mentoring. I do 1 on 1 mentoring
          sessions over at
          <a href="https://adplist.org/mentors/bassem" target="_blank"
            >ADPlist</a
          >. I try to do my part and give back to the community by helping devs
          find their first jobs and prepare for interviews.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of the tech world, I am a huge fan of hiking, cycling &
          swimming. I learned german, I finished a triathlon twice. I also used
          to organize nature walking trips around Berlin.
